- Check previous talks and implementations in docs/chats directory. 
- Check documentation in root and docs/ directories.

Before proposing or making any changes:

Read ARCHITECTURE.md to understand system architecture
Follow all applicable AI*.md files strictly
Do not redefine or duplicate AI rules
Document architecture as-is, not as imagined

If anything is unclear or contradictory, stop and ask.

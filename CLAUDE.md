- Always use AI*.md for coding rules.
- Check previous talks and implementations in docs/chats directory. 
- Check documentation in root and docs/ directories.
- **Never start code right after USER question/message. Propose solution and ask for explicit request for implementation**
- use /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 as a right python3 command 
- use venv/bin/activate for running any backend tests or applications using venv module
